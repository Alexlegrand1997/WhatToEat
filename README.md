Hi everyone that are reading this :D

This is one of my personnal project with the goal to improve my knowledge and skill in programming with Kotlin and Jetpack Compose.
This is also to make my portfolio grow since i am looking for a job in Android Natif Developpment.
If you see the code and see some improvement that i should make feel free to let me know because there is definitly a lot of thing that i 
still have to learn

But enough about me and what is the application and what is it for:

The WhatToEat app is pretty straigh foward with the name. It is an application made to help people find idea to eat for lunch.

The application use the API of Spoonacular that can be found at the following link : https://spoonacular.com/food-api

Home page (Not completly implemented yet)

Favorite page :

This page is use to register all the recipe that are interesting and that the user would like to be able to retrieve quickly.
To respect Spoonacular API just the id, name of the recipe and picture url are save. So the client will still have to make a request to the api
to go get the information of the recipe.
